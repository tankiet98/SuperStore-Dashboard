## 🔑 Key Insights  

### 1️⃣ Net Sales & Profit (by Quarters)  
- 📈 Quarterly profit growth is **highly volatile**: from -58% (2017-Q1) to +153% (2016-Q4).  
- 🎯 **Q4 consistently peaks** with the strongest sales & profit, while Q1 slumps due to post-holiday demand gap.  
- ⚠️ **Margins under pressure**: fell to 9.6% in 2017-Q4 despite record sales.  

### 2️⃣ Sales & Margin by Category and Sub-category  
- 🪑 **Furniture**: high sales but very low profitability (2.4%). Tables (-8.8%) and Bookcases (-3.3%) drag performance.  
- 💻 **Technology**: top sales (763K) and healthy margin (17.2%). Copiers (36.1%) and Accessories (25.3%) are standout drivers.  
- 📦 **Office Supplies**: strong margins (17.2%) with small sub-categories as profit boosters (Paper 43.2%, Labels 44.3%).  

### 3️⃣ Regional & Segment Analysis  
- 👥 **Consumer dominates** all regions, especially East (323K) and West (301K).  
- 🌍 **East region** is the strongest and most balanced market.  
- 🏢 Corporate & Home Office are smaller but provide stability.  

### 4️⃣ State-level Concentration (Pareto Analysis)  
- 🥇 Top 3 states (CA, NY, TX) = ~40% of sales.  
- 🏅 Top 15 states = ~75% of sales.  
- ⚠️ High dependency on a few states → concentration risk.  

### 5️⃣ Yearly Tracking (2014–2017)  
- 📊 Revenue grows year-over-year, but margins fluctuate.  
- 🎯 Seasonal peaks in Q4 every year.  
- ⚠️ Margin volatility suggests heavy discounting or weak product mix.  

### 6️⃣ Cohort & Retention Analysis  
- 🔄 Growth is **retention-driven**: older cohorts (2014–2015) keep repurchasing years later.  
- 🆕 New customers fell sharply (595 in 2014 → 11 in 2017).  
- 📉 Reliance on repeat customers shows loyalty strength but weak acquisition funnel.  

---

## 📈 Results  
- ✅ The business relies heavily on **loyal, repeat customers**, ensuring stable revenue.  
- ⚠️ **New customer acquisition collapsed** after 2014, posing long-term growth risk.  
- 💡 Profitability varies by category and product → opportunities to optimize product mix.  
- 🌍 Revenue concentration in a handful of states/regions increases exposure to risk.  
- 📌 Overall, the project provides **actionable insights** for:  
  - Strengthening acquisition strategies.  
  - Leveraging high-margin products.  
  - Balancing retention vs. growth.  
  - Reducing dependency on key states and regions.
