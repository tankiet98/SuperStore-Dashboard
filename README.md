## 🔑 Key Insights  

### 1️⃣ Net Sales & Profit (by Quarters)  
- 📈 **Strong seasonality**: Q4 consistently peaks with the highest sales & profit, while Q1 slumps due to post-holiday effects.  
- 💰 **Margins under pressure**: Profit margins average 10–13%, but dropped to just 9.6% in Q4-2017.  
- ⭐ **2016 Q4 benchmark**: Delivered both the strongest sales growth (+153%) and highest margin (16.7%).  

### 2️⃣ Sales & Margin by Category and Sub-category  
- 🪑 **Furniture**: High sales but very low profitability (2.4%), with unprofitable items (Tables -8.8%, Bookcases -3.3%).  
- 💻 **Technology**: Highest sales (763K) and healthy profitability (17.2%), driven by **Copiers (36.1%)** and **Accessories (25.3%)**.  
- 📦 **Office Supplies**: Smaller sub-categories deliver exceptionally high margins (**Paper 43.2%**, **Labels 44.3%**, **Envelopes 42.1%**).  

### 3️⃣ Regional & Segment Analysis  
- 👥 **Consumer dominates** across all regions, especially East (323K) and West (301K).  
- 🌍 **East region** is the strongest overall market, while **South lags behind**.  
- 🏢 **Corporate & Home Office** provide stability but remain smaller contributors.  

### 4️⃣ State-level Sales Concentration (Pareto Analysis)  
- 🥇 **Top 3 states (CA, NY, TX)** generate ~40% of total sales.  
- 🏅 **Top 15 states** contribute ~75% of sales → strong revenue concentration.  
- 🌐 The remaining 30+ states account for only 25% collectively.  

### 5️⃣ Yearly Tracking (2014–2017)  
- 📊 Revenue grew consistently year over year, but margins fluctuated.  
- 🎯 Seasonal peaks are clearly visible in Q4 across all years.  
- ⚠️ Profit margin volatility suggests heavy discounting or cost structure issues in certain months.  

### 6️⃣ Cohort & Retention Analysis  
- 🔄 **Retention is the key driver**: many customers from early cohorts (2014–2015) continued to purchase in later years.  
- 🆕 **Customer acquisition is weak**: New customers dropped from 595 in 2014 → only 11 in 2017.  
- 📉 Growth heavily depends on **repeat customers**, highlighting loyalty strength but also risk from lack of new inflows.  

---

## 📈 Results  
- ✅ The business shows **solid repeat purchase behavior**, with strong loyalty among existing customers.  
- ⚠️ However, **customer acquisition sharply declined** after 2014, limiting long-term growth potential.  
- 💡 Profitability varies widely by product and category, indicating opportunities to **optimize pricing and product mix**.  
- 🌍 Regional concentration is high, with a few states and customer segments driving most of the revenue.  
- 📌 Overall, the dashboard and analyses provide actionable insights for:  
  - Strengthening acquisition strategies.  
  - Leveraging high-margin products.  
  - Balancing retention vs. growth.  
  - Diversifying across regions to reduce risk.
